# openbadges-bakery example
This is a small project just to see how it works  
For installing dependencies:
* npm i

## For issuing a badge
node issue.js {path to image}  
we can use eclip.png as example
* node issue.js eclip.png

all baked images will be in the baked/ folder . 
so you can check there for your badge   

## For verificate a badge 
node issue.js {path to image}  
* node verificate.js baked/eclip.png

we can use [exiftool](https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool) to check metadata
